# Hybrid Dynamic Ensemble for Magnificent Seven Return Forecasting

**COMP3931 Individual Project | University of Leeds**

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to forecast next-day stock returns for the Magnificent Seven. It combines linear models, tree-based ensembles, and an LSTM under an adaptive weighting framework. A backtested trading strategy and full statistical evaluation are included. The results are reported honestly, including where things did not work.

## Overview

Together, the Magnificent Seven (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA) make up around 33.7% of the S&P 500. Their short-term returns are hard to forecast. Daily price movements are noisy, and the relationships between predictors and returns can change quickly. This project tests whether a dynamically weighted ensemble of different model types can improve prediction accuracy and backtested trading performance.

The pipeline is fully reproducible from the raw data stage. It downloads raw price and macroeconomic data, builds the feature set, and splits the data in strict chronological order to avoid temporal leakage. Four classical regressors and an LSTM are then trained on the prepared data. The Hybrid Dynamic Ensemble combines the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM predictions using a rolling performance-based weighting scheme. The backtest adds a one-day signal lag, VIX-based threshold adjustment, fractional position sizing, drawdown control, and five basis-point transaction costs.

The main finding is that adaptive weighting did not provide a reliable improvement over simpler baselines. The model weights stayed close to a uniform allocation across the test period, suggesting that recent prediction errors were too noisy to identify the strongest model consistently. The HDE produced positive trading performance and reduced drawdown, but it did not outperform Buy-and-Hold on total return or Sharpe ratio. This result is still useful, as it highlights the difficulty of finding stable daily return signals in highly liquid mega-cap equities.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Temporal integrity:** The train/val/test split is strictly chronological. Training runs through 2022, validation is 2023, and the test set is 2024-2025. The StandardScaler is fitted on training data only.
- **Per-ticker LSTM sequences:** Sequences are built separately for each ticker so rolling windows don't leak across stocks.
- **Warm-up handling:** During the LSTM warm-up window, the ensemble runs on RF and GB only. LSTM is added once it has enough history.
- **Bias correction:** Before combining models, the ensemble subtracts each model's recent weighted prediction bias. This cuts down on systematic over- or under-shooting.
- **Reproducibility:** Random seed 42 is set globally. All artifacts are deterministic across runs on the same hardware.

| Equity data | yfinance | 0.2.66 |
| Macro data | fredapi | 0.5.2 |
| Env vars | python-dotenv | 1.0.1 |
| Data wrangling | pandas, numpy | 2.3.3, 1.26.4 |

| Plots | matplotlib | 3.9.2 |
| Tests | pytest | 8.3.3 |
| Notebooks | jupyter, ipykernel | >= 1.0.0, >= 6.25.0 |

**Python:** 3.11+

The experiments for this project were run on a Mac with an Apple M2 chip and 16 GB of memory, running macOS 26.3.1. The LSTM training loop used MPS acceleration where available, with CPU fallback where needed.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- pip
- A FRED API key, free at [fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html). This is only needed for script 02, which pulls macro data.

### Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your FRED API key:

```env
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key_here
```

The key is only needed for `scripts/02_feature_engineering.py`. This script downloads the macroeconomic variables used in the project, including the Federal Funds Rate, 10-year Treasury yield, VIX, CPI, and unemployment rate.

If data/raw/macro_fred.csv already exists from a previous run, you can skip script 02 and continue from script 03.

---

## Running the pipeline

Run the full pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

This runs scripts 01 to 07 in order. Each script checks its inputs first, and the pipeline stops if any step fails.

Run the Chapter 4 evaluation only:

```bash
python run_evaluation.py
```

This requires `data/results/hde_final_results.csv` and produces the tables, figures, and summary files used in Chapter 4.

### Running scripts individually

Each stage can also be run on its own:

```bash
python scripts/01_data_collection.py
python scripts/02_feature_engineering.py
python scripts/03_build_master_dataset.py
python scripts/04_regression_data_preprocessing.py
python scripts/05_train_baseline_regressors.py
python scripts/06_train_lstm_regressor.py
python scripts/07_build_enhanced_hde.py
```

Run them in order, as each script depends on outputs from the previous stage.

---

## Results summary

Outputs are saved in `data/results/`. The `evaluation/` folder contains the Chapter 4 tables and figures.

### Predictive performance, test set 2024

| Model | MAE | Directional Accuracy |
|-------|-----|----------------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.0173 | 50.2% |
| Ridge Regression | 0.0174 | 50.1% |
| Random Forest | **0.0167** | 52.1% |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.0183 | 51.0% |
| LSTM | 0.0181 | **53.9%** |
| HDE | 0.0179 | 51.5% |

### Strategy performance, test set 2024

| Strategy | Total Return | Sharpe | Max Drawdown |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| HDE | 32.4% | 1.09 | -18.1% |
| Equal-weight ensemble | 9.4% | 0.36 | n/a |
| Buy-and-hold | **110.9%** | **1.51** | -29.0% |

Best validation configuration: `window=10`, `decay=0.9`, `threshold=0.0005`, `VIX_low=16.6`, `VIX_high=22.55`.

---
## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Run with detailed output:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Stop after the first failure:

```bash
pytest tests/ -x
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_ensemble.py -v
```

The test suite covers the main parts of the project: model setup, ensemble weighting, feature calculations, preprocessing, performance metrics, backtesting, and end-to-end output checks.

The tests use small synthetic examples rather than the full dataset. They run quickly and do not require downloaded data or trained models.
---

## Known Limitations

**Dynamic weighting barely moves.** The main takeaway from the project is that the adaptive weighting mechanism settles near uniform weights (roughly 1/3 each for RF, GB, and LSTM) and stays there. The "dynamic" part adds little over a plain equal-weight ensemble on this dataset.

**LSTM warm-up gap.** For the first `seq_len` trading days of the test period, LSTM predictions do not exist. The ensemble falls back to RF and GB during that window, which creates a small inconsistency in the earliest test-set predictions.

**FRED API key needed for macro data.** Script 02 will not run without a valid FRED API key in `.env`. If you have an existing `macro_fred.csv`, drop it into `data/raw/` and start from script 03.

**Models and raw data are not in the repo.** The repository ships with result CSVs and evaluation outputs. The trained `.pkl` and `.pth` files and the raw downloaded data are all gitignored. A clean run from scratch needs internet access for yfinance and FRED, and takes roughly 20 to 40 minutes. The LSTM tuning step is the slowest part.

**The test window is one bull-market year.** The backtest only covers 2024, which was an unusually strong year for the Magnificent Seven. Buy-and-hold benefits a lot from that. Testing across a longer window with different regimes would likely give a fairer comparison.

**No live trading.** This is a research pipeline. There is no order management, slippage modelling, or live data feed.
